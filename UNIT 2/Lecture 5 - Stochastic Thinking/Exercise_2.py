#This problem asks you to write a short function that uses the the random module. Click on the above link to be taken to the Python docs on the random module, where you can see all sorts of cool functions the module provides.

#The random module has many useful functions - play around with them in your interpreter to see how much you can do! To test this code yourself, put the line import random at the top of your code file, to import all of the functions in the random module. To call random module methods, preface them with random., as in this sample interpreter session:

>>> import random
>>> random.randint(1, 5)
4
>>> random.choice(['apple', 'banana', 'cat'])
'cat'
#How would you randomly generate an even number x, 0 <= x < 100? Fill out the definition for the function genEven(). Please generate a uniform distribution over the even numbers between 0 and 100 (not including 100).

import random
def genEven():
    '''
    Returns a random even number x, where 0 <= x < 100
    '''
    return random.randrange(0, 100, 2)
