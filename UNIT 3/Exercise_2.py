You are taking samples of the ages of two populations, A and B. Population A is all the residents of San Francisco, while Population B is all the residents of Los Angeles.

The sample from Population A has a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 1. The sample from Population B has a mean of 45 and a standard deviation of 15. Which of the following are certain?

#=============================================================================================
The average age of the sample of Population A is lower than the average age of the sample of Population B.

A sample size of 1 million is more appropriate than a sample size of 10 for these populations.
