#Part B: Problem 1: Implementing a Simple Simulation (No Drug Treatment)
#=======================================================================

#15.0/15.0 points (graded)
#We start with a trivial model of the virus population - the patient does not take any drugs and the viruses do not acquire resistance to drugs. We simply model the virus population inside a patient as if it were left untreated.

#SimpleVirus class
#To implement this model, you will need to fill in the SimpleVirus class, which maintains the state of a single virus particle. You will implement the methods __init__, getMaxBirthProb, getClearProb,doesClear, and reproduce according to the specifications. Use random.random() for generating random numbers to ensure that your results are consistent with ours.

#Hint: random seed

#The reproduce method in SimpleVirus should produce an offspring by returning a new instance of SimpleVirus with probability: self.maxBirthProb * (1 - popDensity). This method raises a NoChildException if the virus particle does not reproduce. For a reminder on raising execptions, review the Python docs.

#self.maxBirthProb is the birth rate under optimal conditions (the virus population is negligible relative to the available host cells so there is ample nourishment available). popDensity is defined as the ratio of the current virus population to the maximum virus population for a patient and should be calculated in the update method of the Patient class.

#Patient class
#You will also need to implement the Patient class, which maintains the state of a virus population associated with a patient.

#The update method in the Patient class is the inner loop of the simulation. It modifies the state of the virus population for a single time step and returns the total virus population at the end of the time step. At every time step of the simulation, each virus particle has a fixed probability of being cleared (eliminated from the patient's body). If the virus particle is not cleared, it is considered for reproduction. If you utilize the population density correctly, you shouldn't need to provide an explicit check that the virus population exceeds maxPop when you are calculating how many offspring are added to the population -- you just calculate the new population density and use that for the next call to update.

#Unlike the clearance probability, which is constant, the probability of a virus particle reproducing is a function of the virus population. With a larger virus population, there are fewer resources in the patient's body to facilitate reproduction, and the probability of reproduction will be lower. One way to think of this limitation is to consider that virus particles need to make use of a patient's cells to reproduce; they cannot reproduce on their own. As the virus population increases, there will be fewer available host cells for viruses to utilize for reproduction.

#To summarize, update should first decide which virus particles are cleared and which survive by making use of the doesClear method of each SimpleVirus instance, then update the collection of SimpleVirus instances accordingly. With the surviving SimpleVirus instances, update should then call the reproduce method for each virus particle. Based on the population density of the surviving SimpleVirus instances, reproduce should either return a new instance of SimpleVirus representing the offspring of the virus particle, or raise a NoChildException indicating that the virus particle does not reproduce during the current time step. The update method should update the attributes of the patient appropriately under either of these conditions. After iterating through all the virus particles, the update method returns the number of virus particles in the patient at the end of the time step.

#Hint: mutating objects

#Note that the mapping between time steps and actual time will vary depending on the type of virus being considered, but for this problem set, think of a time step as a simulated hour of time.

#About the grader: When defining a Patient class member variable to store the viruses list representing the virus population, please use the name self.viruses in order for your code to be compatible with the grader and to pass one of the tests.

#If you want to use numpy arrays, you should import numpy as np and use np.METHOD_NAME in your code.
