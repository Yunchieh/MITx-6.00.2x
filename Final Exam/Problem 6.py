#Write a function that meets the specifications below. You do not have to use dynamic programming.

#Hint: You might want to use bin() on an int to get a string, get rid of the first two characters, add leading 0's as needed, and then convert it to a numpy array of ints. Type help(bin) in the console.

#For example,

#If choices = [1,2,2,3] and total = 4 you should return either [0 1 1 0] or [1 0 0 1]
#If choices = [1,1,3,5,3] and total = 5 you should return [0 0 0 1 0]
#If choices = [1,1,1,9] and total = 4 you should return [1 1 1 0]
#More specifically, write a function that meets the specifications below:

def find_combination(choices, total):
    """
    choices: a non-empty list of ints
    total: a positive int
 
    Returns result, a numpy.array of length len(choices) 
    such that
        * each element of result is 0 or 1
        * sum(result*choices) == total
        * sum(result) is as small as possible
    In case of ties, returns any result that works.
    If there is no result that gives the exact total, 
    pick the one that gives sum(result*choices) closest 
    to total without going over.
    """
#Paste your entire function (including the definition) in the box.

#Note: If you want to use numpy arrays, you should add the following 3 lines before your code:

#import os
#os.environ["OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS"] = "1"
#import numpy as np
#And use np.METHOD_NAME in your code. Unfortunately, pylab does not work with the grader.
