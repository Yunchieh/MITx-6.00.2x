#Changing the initial conditions from 500 rabbits and 30 foxes to 50 rabbits and 300 foxes changes the general shapes of both the polyfit curves for the rabbit population and fox population.

False

#Let's say we make a change in the original simulation. That is, we are going to change one detail in the original simulation, but everything else will remain the same as it was explained in Problem 8 - Part A.

#Now, if a fox fails in hunting, it has a 90 percent chance of dying (instead of a 10 percent chance, as in the original simulation).

#Changing the probability of an unsuccessful fox dying from 10% to 90% changes the general shapes of both the polyfit curves for the rabbit population and fox population.

False
