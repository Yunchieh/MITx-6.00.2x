#Problem 1-1

#1/1 point (graded)
#Consider deriving the probability of a coin flip coming up heads by running m trials of 100 flips each. If the coin is fair, the mean probability of the m trials will go to 0.5 as m goes to infinity.

True

#Problem 1-2

#0/1 point (graded)
#Consider two normal distributions, A and B. The standard deviation of A is 3 and the standard deviation of B is 5. For each distribution, 1,000 observations are drawn and plotted in a histogram with 10 bins, creating one histogram for each distribution.

The rightmost bin of A will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of B. inncorrect

#Problem 1-3

#1/1 point (graded)
#You roll an unfair (weighted) die. The distribution of the numbers rolled is a uniform distribution.

False

#Problem 1-4

#1/1 point (graded)
#A simulation

All of the above

#Problem 1-5

#1/1 point (graded)
#The following image plots the population of the US over time, along with a model fit to the data. This is an example of

overfitting

#Problem 1-6

#1/1 point (graded)
#If the  of a model produced using linear regression is 0.7, the model accounts for 70% of the variance in the observations.

True

#Problem 1-7

#1/1 point (graded)
#Given a finite set of data points there exists a polynomial fit such that the polynomial curve goes through each point in the data.

False

#Problem 1-8

#1/1 point (graded)
#You want to calculate confidence intervals by applying the empirical rule, which requires that you have a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation. Which approach can you use to estimate the mean and standard deviation that you need? Choose all that work.

Central Limit Theorem, which requires that you have many sufficiently large samples from the population
Standard Error, which requires that you have one sufficiently large sample

#Problem 1-9

#5.0/5.0 points (graded)
#You have a bucket with 4 red balls and 4 green balls. You draw 3 balls out of the bucket. Assume that once you draw a ball out of the bucket, you don't replace it. What is the probability of drawing 3 balls of the same color? Answer the question in reduced fraction form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.
