#Exercise 3
#4/4 points (graded)
#For questions 1 and 2, consider our previous problem (permutations of 3 students in a line).

#When represented as a tree, each node will have how many children?

#Given two permutations, what is the maximum number of swaps it will take to reach one from the other?

#For questions 3 and 4, consider the general case of our previous problem (permutations of n students in a line). Give your answer in terms of n.

#When represented as a tree, each node will have how many children?

n - 1
 
Given two permutations, what is the maximum number of swaps it will take to reach one from the other?

n * (n - 1)/2
